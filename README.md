# Description

This is a simple currency mod for The Digital Farms Minetest server, although it could easily be used elsewhere

# Details

This mod provides denominations of currency in the form of ones, tens, twenties, hundreds, and quarters (coins). The currency is created by converting silver ingots into ones. These can then be converted into higher or lower denominations in the crafting grid. For example, a single 1 will produce 4 quarters, and 5 will make a 5 dollar bill. $5 bills can be converted to tens and twenties, or back to ones. Tens can be converted to 20s or fives, but not hundreds.

# FAQ (or potentially asked questions

**Why silver ingots?**

Silver ingots / lumps are underutilized on The Digital Farms. Very few recipes call for them, and they aren't commonly used as building material. At the same time, they're not renewable and they are scarcer than, say, sand. So they will be relatively stable or slightly deflationary in value. Gold would make the value of the money higher, so it would only be used on higher-value items. And it has other uses, like protector blocks, that would make people less likely to adopt it. Tin and copper are probably too common, so the prices on items would be higher.

**The currency is really ugly! Can I fix it?**

Feel free to create nicer looking images and create a pull request. I made them in like an hour, and I'm not an artist.

**Why a base-10 currency**

I thought it would be more intuitive than a base 9 currency (one that follows the crafting grid / normal item stack size).
